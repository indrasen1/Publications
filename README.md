# Selected publications

This is a repository containing some of my relevant past publications and associated supplementary information. I wanted to share these so that they are accessible and free to read for any interested individual who is curious about science/engineering within these topics (computational imaging, 3D printing, photonics). The naming scheme is as follows:
[Topic]\_[subtopic]\_[year]\_[supplement].pdf

CAL: computed axial lithography
High fidelity: high fidelity volumetric additive manufacturing
NP: nanopillar
QCL: quantum cascade laser

I am either listed as first author or co-first author with equal contributions on these publications and feel comfortable answering good faith queries related to them. I am incredibly grateful to my advisors, collaborators and colleagues on these projects. Feel free to send an email regarding any questions or comments here: indrasen[at]berkeley[dot]edu
